# ADS-B and Onboard GPS Technologies

## Comparing the aircraft surveillance data (air tour data) recorded by ADS-B data logger and Onboard navigation (GPS) technologies in Denali National Park and Reserve, Alaska


Aircraft have been employing different technologies for aircraft monitoring or surveillance. The three main types of aircraft surveillance technologies are:
1. Radar-based aircraft surveillance
2. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)
3. Other Satellite Communication Devices


Meanwhile, air tours have become a popular mode of sightseeing in many parks and protected areas that have iconic landscapes (Beeco & Joyce, 2019).

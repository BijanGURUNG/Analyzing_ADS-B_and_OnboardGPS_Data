# ADS-B and Onboard GPS Technologies in Spatial Monitoring of Overflights

## Comparing the aircraft surveillance data (air tour data) recorded by ADS-B data logger and Onboard navigation (GPS) technologies in Denali National Park and Reserve, Alaska


Aviation Authorities have been employing different technologies for aircraft monitoring or surveillance. The three main types of aircraft surveillance technologies are:
1. Radar-based aircraft surveillance
2. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)
3. Other Satellite Communication Devices

Radio detection and ranging (RADAR) is a type of passive remote sensing. In a radar system, radio equipment emits radio waves into the air or to the target and the waves are received after reflection from the target or object in the path of the beam. The time taken by the radio signals to return to the antenna is used to measure the range and the position of the rotating antenna determines the direction of the target (Federal Aviation Authority, 2023).  


Meanwhile, air tours have become a popular mode of sightseeing in many parks and protected areas that have iconic landscapes (Beeco & Joyce, 2019).
